Introduction
The Bechdel Test, first introduced by Alison Bechdel in her comic strip Dykes to Watch Out For, has three steps a film must achieve to pass: there must be two or more named, female characters; they must talk to each other; and their conversation cannot revolve around a male character. While there are some flaws with using this test—like not taking race or sexuality into account—it is a great starting point when analyzing films with a feminist point of view. If the gender was reversed, almost all films would certainly pass without question or discussion. And the fact that many films made even this year don’t pass all three steps shows that the Bechdel Test is still a relevant tool. 
Christopher Nolan, an acclaimed British director and writer, only has one film pass out of the seven films analyzed in this essay. And it’s important to note that the only film he didn’t write the script for was Insomnia—the original film’s screenplay was written by Erik Skjoldbjærg and Nikolaj Frobenius, and Nolan’s adaptation was written by Hillary Seitz. Not only was Nolan responsible for how his female characters were portrayed and how they interreacted with each other on screen, but in all but one he created his female characters by himself or with his brother Jonathan. The analyzed filmography spans from 2000 to 2014 and includes both stand-alone features and two films in a trilogy. 


Memento
Memento, Nolan’s second feature film, premiered in 2000. It passes the first step of the Bechdel Test: there are a few female characters with names. Natalie, portrayed by Carrie-Anne Moss, is the only female character alive when the main story takes place. Leonard’s wife is dead, and Sammy Jenkins’ wife is revealed to be a figment of Leonard’s coping mechanism. 
The film uses a non-linear timeline to showcase Leonard’s cycle of revenge to seek justice for his dead wife. Because Leonard has short-term memory loss, this non-linear format allows the audience to see the world as Leonard sees it. Truth is revealed to both the audience and the character at the same time. Laura Mulvey coined the term “male gaze” in her article “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema” to describe how women are styled on screen. Males have an active role, where they are the spectators—while females have a passive role, becoming objects to be looked at (Mulvey 11). The male gaze encompasses both the visual and the narrative of a film (12). 
At first, the audience sees Natalie as a trusting, almost nurturing character. Leonard thinks she’s helping him because she pities him. However, as the film progresses, it’s revealed that Leonard killed Natalie’s boyfriend. Because he doesn’t remember, she decides to use it against him: “You know what? I think I'm gonna use you. I'm telling you now because I'll enjoy it so much more if I know that you could stop me if you weren't such a [expletive] freak!” (Nolan, Memento). And while she gets the satisfaction of having Leonard get rid of someone for her, the audience doesn’t get to engage with her for long. Natalie is merely a stepping stone for the rest of Leonard’s narrative. The audience isn’t supposed to care about Natalie because the male protagonist is what’s important (Mulvey 12), but it makes Natalie’s character simply an object with no real agency. The female character has a name, but it’s the only developed thing about her. She only exists to make Leonard go deeper in his cycle for revenge. 
Insomnia
	As previously stated, Nolan didn’t write the script for Insomnia (2000). But that doesn’t excuse Insomnia for also only passing the first step of the Bechdel Test. There are multiple female characters with names in this film, but they are never shown talking to each other on screen. Ellie, portrayed by Hilary Swank, is the female character with the most importance. She is essentially a mirror for Al Pacino’s character Dormer. Not only does Ellie admire Dormer as a detective, but she studied him and his methods. 
	Ellie is shown as a smart detective from the start. She figures out pretty much right away that something isn’t right with the death of another detective. But because her investigation is separated from the one Dormer is working on, she appears isolated from the main action. When she finishes her report, she asks Dormer for approval. He tells her to look it over again, since her reputation would be on the line if something were wrong (Nolan). When she confronts Dormer about the death, the other detectives laugh in her face—showing that she is seen inferior from the rest of the police force. She investigates Finch on her own, but almost gets killed in the process. Dormer rescues her, like a damsel in distress. As Dormer dies in Ellie’s arms, she tries to throw the shell casing that would ruin Dormer’s reputation. Dormer stops her, saying, “Don’t lose your way” (Nolan). In the end, it’s Dormer who protects Ellie, cementing Dormer as the active male and Ellie as the passive female. 
Batman Begins and The Dark Knight
	Batman Begins (2005) also only passes the first step of the Bechdel Test. There are a few women named, like Martha Wayne, but they aren’t important and don’t talk to each other. The Dark Knight (2008) is the first Nolan film to pass the second step: the female characters must talk to each other. Near the beginning of the film, Rachel Dawes is having dinner with Harvey Dent. Bruce Wayne and his date Natascha sit down at the table. Natascha and Rachel talk to each other, but they’re talking about Batman’s role in Gotham City. Much later in the film, Officer Ramirez calls Gordan’s wife Barbara on the phone. It doesn’t pass the third step because Ramirez is just repeating the words of a man as she’s being held at gunpoint. 
Rachel Dawes, portrayed by Katie Holmes, is the love interest of Bruce Wayne—and that’s the only reason she’s important to the narrative. In Batman Begins, Rachel helps Bruce understand the difference between revenge and justice. At the end of the first film, Rachel tells Bruce that she wants to be with him, but only when he’s done being Batman (Nolan). In The Dark Knight, Rachel—now portrayed by Maggie Gyllenhaal—only appears on screen for 11 minutes (Kvaran 220). However, she does exhibit some agency before she is killed by the Joker. She writes a letter to Bruce, telling him she can never be with him:
Dear Bruce. I need to be honest and clear. I'm going to marry Harvey Dent. I love him, and I want to spend the rest of my life with him. When I told you that if Gotham no longer needed Batman we could be together, I meant it. But now I'm sure the day won't come when you no longer need Batman. I hope it does; and if it does, I will be there, but as your friend. I'm sorry to let you down. If you lose your faith in me, please keep your faith in people. Love, now and always, Rachel. (Nolan)
The irony is that no one gets to read her letter besides Alfred. And Alfred purposefully keeps the letter from Bruce so that he’ll use her death as a motivation to keep being Batman. Rachel’s death also acts as a catalyst for Harvey Dent to become Two-Face. Rachel’s only purpose in the second film is to die, furthering the male characters’ plotlines (Kvaran 231). 
The Prestige
The Prestige, which premiered in 2006 between the two Batman films, only passes the first step of the Bechdel Test. Sarah, portrayed by Rebecca Hall, and Olivia, portrayed by Scarlet Johansson, are the two love interests. This film also uses non-linear storytelling, which perpetuates the male gaze. At first, it appears that Alfred is married to Sarah, but is having an affair with Olivia. However, as the film progresses, it’s much weirder than that. Alfred is actually two people: Albert and Freddie. Albert is the one who fell in love with Sarah, and Freddie is the one who fell in love with Olivia. 
Instead of stopping both relationships or picking just one, the twins go along with their ruse like it makes perfect sense to them. In the end, it costs them both women. Sarah commits suicide. Freddie wants to keep being with Olivia, but she rejects him:
OLIVIA. You married her. You had a child with her.
ALFRED. Yes. Part of me did. But the other part... the other part didn't. The part that found you, the part that's sitting here right now.
OLIVIA. You could be in some other cafe saying the same thing about me right now. It's inhuman to be so cold (Nolan).
This is another hint at agency that a female character gets to have. However, it’s not a happy choice—she sees that “Alfred” will cause her the same pain he caused Sarah. “Alfred” however gets the best ending, even though the twins were the ones causing harm. One of the twins, possibly Albert, gets to be a free man—an active male—and spend the rest of his days with his daughter. 
Inception
Inception, which premiered in 2010, passes the second step of the Bechdel Test. Ariadne, portrayed by Ellen Page, is the only female member on the team. Cobb’s wife Mal is portrayed by Marian Cotillard. They have two conversations, but they both center around Cobb. There is some caution among critics, as Mal is a subconscious projection of Cobb’s memories and not a real person when she and Ariadne talk. However, it doesn’t pass the third step, so it doesn’t really matter. 
Like Rachel in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, Ariadne’s purpose shifts from being needed to being used. At first, Ariadne is recruited to build the dreams for their heist. Once she finishes, her job is supposed to be over. She decides to come with the rest of the team when she discovers Cobb can’t control his projection of Mal. From that point on, she is less seen as an equal member of the team, and more as a therapist to help Cobb heal from the death of his wife. She is the only female character besides Mal, so she gets the nurturing role of the group. 
Mal isn’t even real; she’s Cobb’s memory of Mal when she was alive. Cobb tries to keep her buried deep inside his subconscious, but he can’t keep her trapped forever. When he and Ariadne reach the deepest level to rescue Fischer, Cobb finally destroys the memory of his wife: 
COBB. I can't stay with her anymore because she doesn't exist.
MAL. I'm the only thing you do believe in anymore.
COBB. I wish. I wish more than anything. But I can't imagine you with all your complexity, all your perfection, all your imperfection. Look at you. You are just a shade of my real wife. You're the best I can do; but I'm sorry, you’re just not good enough (Nolan). 
The concept of Mal is the male gaze pushed to the extreme. Not only is she attached to Cobb because she’s his idea of her, but even that can’t be enough for him. It’s only when she tries to have an active voice in the visual and the narrative does Cobb put an end to her. 
Interstellar
Interstellar, which premiered in 2014, is the only Nolan film that passes all three steps of the Bechdel Test—and it’s not an achievement to be celebrated. Murph, portrayed by Jessica Chastain, visits her brother and his family. Her brother’s wife Lois and Murph talk about dinner and the work that Murph does at her job. There is another scene where a young Murph is shown with Amelia Brand, portrayed by Anne Hathaway, but they never directly speak to each other, so that doesn’t count. 
Amelia Brand and Murph are probably Nolan’s best written female characters, but they still fall victim to tropes. Brand is an exceptional scientist and the only female on the mission to find a new planet. After she makes a mistake by calculating incorrectly, she is still regarded as an equal because Cooper also makes a mistake. The main thing that keeps her in a passive role is her attachment to another male character. She tries to negotiate which planet to travel to next: “Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it” (Nolan). The other crew members, especially Cooper, completely disregard her ideas—even though her planet and her concept of love were both correct. 
Murph is the first female character to achieve an active, spectator role. However, her motivations are grounded in paternal issues, which have been previously used by Nolan and others on male protagonists (Kvaran 219). Her identity revolves around her father Cooper for most of the film. When she realizes that Plan A was never going to happen, she seeks answers from her childhood ghost. She’s able to save the world because her father is her ghost and gives the information to her (Nolan). By applying a traditionally masculine trope to a female character, is the achievement less groundbreaking? The only way the narrative separates the two is by having Murph seen as the hero, not Cooper. 
Conclusion 
	The Bechdel Test provides a basis for navigating basic interactions between Christopher Nolan’s female characters. Only one film manages to pass all three steps, with two named, female characters that have a conversation that doesn’t revolve around a male character. In four of his films, none of the women talk to each other on screen. By analyzing the male gaze, coined by Laura Mulvey, it’s clear that most of Nolan’s female characters are passive objects for the male characters to use and abuse. One exception in Interstellar shouldn’t be a groundbreaking notion. When agency and choices are displayed, the male characters seek to destroy it. Christopher Nolan may be an acclaimed director and writer in some regards, but from a feminist perspective he leaves much to be desired.
