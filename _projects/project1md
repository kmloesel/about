## Title

## Introduction ##
The How to Train Your Dragon franchise is one of DreamWorks Animation’s most successful franchises to date (Debruge, 2019). It has three feature films, two television shorts, and eight television show seasons. The story follows Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, voiced by Jay Baruchel, as he goes from a young teenager afraid of dragons to becoming the Chief of his village. How to Train Your Dragon, directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, was released in 2010. In this film, Hiccup changes his village’s way of thinking by showing them how to bond with dragons instead of killing them. How to Train Your Dragon 2, directed by Dean DeBlois, was released in 2014. In this film, Hiccup discovers that his mother is alive, but he also has to deal with his father’s death. And How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, directed by Dean DeBlois, was released in 2019. This film shows Hiccup struggle with being the newly appointed Chief of his village. 
The How to Train Your Dragon trilogy has been praised by critics for tackling tough topics, like physical disabilities and grief (Grant, 2019). Not only do several major characters have physical disabilities, but Hiccup is the first main character of animated movie to have a prosthetic leg. Some of the other heavy topics include a parental figure that is killed by the main character’s best friend and the main character saying goodbye to his best friend in order to save him. But why is it important for family-friendly animated films to cover such serious topics? Why does it matter that the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy discusses physical disability, neurodivergence, and mortality and grief?

The answer lies within educational programming. While the goal of some animated programs is to just simply entertain its viewers, today’s animated films are filled with content that is meant to educate the viewers on the topics that are being discussed. While television programs like Bill Nye the Science Guy and Magic School Bus handle school topics like science and math, educational programming also has the ability to introduce topics that focus more on emotional and social needs (Fisch, 2004). Some historical examples include Mr. Roger’s Neighborhood and Sesame Street (Fish, 2004). Pop culture should have the ability to address social and emotional education in a meaningful, positive way (Ellis, 2016). Recent animated films have delved into theme and representation, but it’s important that certain topics are handled correctly. Children’s content should not only be concerned with presenting information that correct, but also making sure to present that information in an accurate way without stereotypes or prejudices (Ellis, 2019). And all three How to Train Your Dragon films have been praised for doing just that (Debruge, 2019). 

## How to Train Your Dragon ##
### Physical Disability ### 
Within the first five minutes of the film, a major character with a physical disability is introduced. Gobber, Hiccup’s mentor and the town’s blacksmith, has a prosthetic leg and a prosthetic hand. Hiccup’s voiceover states that his prosthetics are interchangeable, and Gobber switches out a hook for a hammer to help fight the dragons. Gobber is instantly shown as a capable character who can help defend the village. About halfway through the film, Gobber tells the tale of how one dragon ate his leg, and then soon after, another dragon ate his hand. One of the students says that he’ll avenge Gobber’s limbs, but Gobber brushes him off. Gobber never sees himself as not a Viking, or someone who can’t defend himself. He is never presented as the ‘other.’

Toothless is the next major character shown with a physical disability. When Hiccup finds the dragon that he shot down, he lets the dragon go. Later, he discovers that the dragon is missing his left tail fin, which makes the dragon unable to fly on his own. Hiccup realizes that he was the one who injured Toothless, so he creates a saddle and prosthetic system that allows Toothless to fly while Hiccup controls the tail fin. The two practice flying together, and soon they become an unstoppable team. Again, Toothless is never shown as being “less than” the other dragons or looked down upon by Hiccup. 

After the final battle at the end of the first film, Hiccup has his left leg amputated. He is shown waking up and discovering that he now has a prosthetic leg. At first, Hiccup panics. But he takes deep breaths and takes it with stride. He even mentions making future adjustments to make it work for him. Hiccup is not treated differently for now having a prosthetic leg. If anything, it’s seen as an “occupational hazard” that happens to some Vikings when dealing with dragons (DeBlois and Sanders, 2010). Hiccup isn’t suddenly defined by his physical disability, nor is he reduced down to that only trait. He is still the main character, who happens to have a prosthetic leg. And, Hiccup’s amputated leg mirrors Toothless’ missing left tail fin. This physically reflects that they are two sides of the same coin. 

### Neurodivergence ###
However, Hiccup is treated badly for not thinking exactly like the rest of the Vikings in his village. This positioning of Hiccup as neurodivergent from the rest of the Vikings is important to the plot. Every young Viking must go through dragon training, and it is expected to kill dragons to defend the village. Early in the first film, Hiccup shows Gobber a new invention to help him kill dragons. Gobber says: You need to stop all of this,” to which Hiccup replies, “You just gestured to all of me” (DeBlois & Sanders, 2010). The Vikings don’t understand why Hiccup can’t just kill dragons. After getting shamed in front of the whole village by his father, Gobber tells Hiccup that it’s what’s inside him that the village can’t stand. Before Stoick goes on a quest to find the dragon’s nest, he tells Hiccup that he has to enroll in dragon training. He tells Hiccup that “you’ll walk like us, talk like us, and think like us” (DeBlois & Sanders, 2010). Again, Hiccup replies with, “You just gestured to all of me” (Deblois & Sanders, 2010). The entire village thinks of Hiccup as ‘other’. 
After bonding with Toothless, Hiccup discovers that the dragons don’t have to be killed at all; in fact, the dragons are only destroying the village because they have to bring back food to their queen. Hiccup progresses through dragon training using the tricks he’s learned with Toothless. Everyone thinks that Hiccup has changed ‘for the better.’ When Stoick realizes how well Hiccup is doing in training, he remarks how now they have things in common, and that he doesn’t have to be embarrassed by Hiccup anymore. 

The final exam for dragon training is killing a dragon. Hiccup tries to show the village that dragons don’t have to be killed, but Stoick turns his back on Hiccup. He tells Hiccup, “You’ve thrown your lot in with them. You’re not a Viking. You’re not my son” (DeBlois & Sanders, 2010). The adult Vikings take off with Toothless to fight the queen dragon. Hiccup and the other training students fly on dragons to rescue them. The adult Vikings stare in wonder as their way of life is questioned: they can bond with dragons instead of killing them. And that’s how the final battle against the queen is won. 

After the final battle, Hiccup discovers Toothless in his house. He panics, thinking that they’ll try to take Toothless again. When he goes outside, he realizes that dragons are now bonding with the Vikings. Stoick tells Hiccup, “Turns out all we needed was a little more of this,” to which Hiccup replies, bewildered, “You just gestured to all of me” (DeBlois & Sanders, 2010). The village accepts Hiccup’s neurodivergence and no longer sees it as ‘other.’ 

## How to Train Your Dragon 2## 
### Physical Disability ###
Both Hiccup and Toothless have prosthetic upgrades in the sequel. At the beginning of the film, Hiccup tests out a new rig system that let Toothless fly on his own. However, it only works if Hiccup activates it. Toothless now has more freedom, but it allows Drago, this film’s villain, to take Toothless after Toothless kills Stoick. There is also some light-hearted humor surrounding Hiccup’s amputated leg. When Valka meets Hiccup for the first time since he was a baby, he tells her tells how Toothless got injured: “Well, crazy thing is... I'M actually the one who... shot him down. Hey, it's okay, though! He got me back! Right, bud? You couldn't save all of me, could you? You just had to make it even. So, peg leg” (DeBlois, 2014). The tone that Hiccup uses shows that he has accepted what happened and feels a kinship with Toothless in their shared physical disability. 

### Neurodivergence ###
Even though Berk adopted Hiccup’s mindset of bonding with dragons, Hiccup is still positioned as ‘opposite’ of his father. The main arc of the second film is Hiccup accepting that he will be Chief of Berk once Stock passes away. At the beginning of the film, Hiccup tells Astrid that Stoick is ready to make Hiccup Chief: “I... I'm not like you. You... know exactly who you are. You always have, but... I'm still looking. I know that I'm not my father, and I never met my mother, so... what does that make me?” (DeBlois, 2014).  Astrid responds, “What you're searching for isn't out there, Hiccup. It's in here. Maybe you just don't see it yet” (DeBlois, 2014). 
When Hiccup meets his mother, he realizes that he’s a lot more like her than his father. She too hated the way Vikings mindlessly killed dragons. Valka asks if Hiccup will stay with her and rescue dragons, and it’s clear that Hiccup wants to say yes. Over the span of five years, he and Toothless had been expanding their world map and exploring new islands in the area.  But he does have a responsibility to his village. After the final battle, Valka decides to stay with Hiccup on Berk and help him with his duties. Hiccup accepts the responsibility of being Chief. At first glance, it might seem like this ‘otherness’ is brushed off quicker than in the first film. But it shows up later in the third film. 

### Mortality and Grief ###
In the first film, Valka isn’t mentioned by name. The only detail that’s revealed about her is that she died when Hiccup was young. In the sequel, her death is explicitly described. When Hiccup was a baby, she was carried off by a dragon during a raid. Everyone assumed she had died. When Hiccup meets her as an adult, he first struggles with the idea that she’s actually alive. Stoick sees her soon after. She tells them her reasoning for not coming back to Berk: 

	I know what you're gonna say, Stoick. How could I have done this? Stayed away all these years? And why didn't I come back to you? To our son? Well, what sign did I have that you could change, Stoick? That anyone on Berk could? I pleaded so many times to stop the fighting, to find another answer, but did any of you listen? I know that I left you to raise Hiccup alone, but I thought he’d be better off without me. And I was wrong. I see that now. (DeBlois, 2014)

They both accept Valka quickly after that. The reunited family has one scene together before Stoick dies. 

Hiccup gains a mother but loses his father. Stoick is killed during a tough battle against Drago. Drago gains control of Toothless and makes Toothless fire at Hiccup. Stoick jumps in front of the blast to save Hiccup. Stoick’s funeral is also shown. It’s a traditional Viking funeral, with Stoick’s body on a ship. Hiccup shoots the first flaming arrow to set the boat on fire. Hiccup struggles with the idea that he’s now the Chief of Berk. He wonders aloud how he can live up to his father. Valka tells him: 

	You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. Oh, so frail, so fragile. I feared you wouldn't make it. But your father, he never doubted. He always said you'd become the strongest of them all. And he was right. You have the heart of a chief and the soul of a dragon. Only you can bring our worlds together. That is who you are, son. (DeBlois, 2014)

Hiccup responds at the end of the funeral: “I, uh... I was so afraid of becoming my dad. Mostly because I thought I never could. How-how do you become someone that great, that brave, that selfless? I guess you can only try. A chief protects his own” (DeBlois, 2014). Besides the ending of the third film, Stoick’s death and funeral are the most mature elements of this family-friendly franchise. 

## How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World ##
### Physical Disability ###
One of the biggest arcs of the third film is the idea that Toothless needs his freedom. Toothless meets a Light Fury and wants to mate with her, but he can only fly on his own if Hiccup activates the switch in the rig system. And the left tail fin can catch on fire. After Hiccup realizes that Toothless wants to fly on his own, Hiccup makes a new tail that is fire-proof and completely works without him. This allows Toothless to leave with the Light Fury and eventually stay in the Hidden World for good.  
Hiccup’s physical disability is sometimes treated as a humorous joke, like when Toothless and Stormfly play fetch with Hiccup’s prosthetic leg. Other times, it’s an essential part of the plot. During the final battle with Grimmel, this film’s villain, Hiccup and Grimmel tumble towards the water. The Light Fury catches Hiccup, and Grimmel holds on to Hiccup’s leg. Hiccup twists his prosthetic leg off, causing Grimmel to fall to his death. While Hiccup says goodbye to Toothless, he leans on Toothless or Astrid for support. 

### Neurodivergence ###
The third film takes place one year after the second one. Hiccup still struggles with being the Chief of Berk. Grimmel tries to intimidate Hiccup by bringing up his father: “Now there was a chief. One of the greatest dragon hunters to have ever lived. What would he think of you? He had it right you know, making it his mission to destroy the beasts so that you could grow up in a better world” (DeBlois, 2019). Hiccup tells him that Stoick changed his mind, and Grimmel says, “And look where that got him” (DeBlois, 2019). 

To get away from Grimmel and save the dragons, Hiccup proposes that Berk relocates closer to the mythical Hidden World. The Vikings question Hiccup at first, but they believe in him. Hiccup doesn’t want to disappoint his people, but he also wants to save the dragons. After a failed attempt, Hiccup is worried that he made the wrong decision. Someone even jokes, with a “who died and made you Chief” comment (DeBlois, 2019). Astrid reminds Hiccup of who he was before Berk accepted dragons, and how he was the one who changed their minds. The Vikings use another one of Hiccup’s unconventional ideas, and they end up saving the dragons and defeating Grimmel. 

### Mortality and Grief ###
Toothless wants the new prosthetic tail so that he can be with the Light Fury without relying on Hiccup to fly. At first, Hiccup is almost jealous of the Light Fury. Toothless never had a reason to leave Hiccup before she showed up. Hiccup has to come to understand that Toothless deserves happiness, and that might not be with Hiccup. During the final battle with Grimmel, the Light Fury has to choose between saving Toothless and saving Hiccup. Hiccup tells her to grab Toothless instead and lets himself fall with Grimmel. Hiccup knew that he might die in the process, but he finally accepted that he couldn’t get in the way of the bond Toothless created with the Light Fury. 

Part of the end of the trilogy is to explain why dragons aren’t around in modern society. Grimmel proves that dragons will never be safe if humans try to control them. This presents a challenge to Hiccup. Over the course of six years, he developed a strong bond with Toothless—and so have all of the Vikings with their own dragons. In a flashback, Hiccup asks Stoick about his mom, who at the time was presumed dead. Stoick tells him: “But with love comes loss, son. It’s part of the deal. Sometimes it hurts, but in the end, it’s all worth it. There’s no greater gift than love” (DeBlois, 2019). Hiccup uses that knowledge to make the choice to let the dragons go to the Hidden World. In a tearful goodbye, Hiccup tells Toothless: “I was so busy fighting for a world that I wanted, I didn’t think about what you needed. You’ve looked after us for long enough. Time to look after yourselves… You’ll be safe there. Safer than you’ll ever be with me” (DeBlois, 2019). The ending shows that in order to believe that dragons are equal to humans, they need to be able to survive on their own. 

## Conclusion ## 
Dean Deblois stated in an interview that films with bittersweet endings are “stories of disparate characters that come together, that affect one another's lives in really profound ways, and if they separate, they'll never be the same again” (Grant, 2019, para. 29). That’s one of the reasons the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy is such a beloved franchise (Debruge, 2019). These films offer a way for parents to start a conversation about heavy topics such as celebrating differences, acknowledging physical and mental disabilities, and understanding and processing grief. These films showcase these topics in a positive, representative way without using stereotypes. All of these are important emotional and social lessons that younger viewers can learn about through the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy.
