"They Do Not Deserve You:" Modern Portrayals of Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn

**Abstract**
This study seeks to understand how the gender of the director plays a role in the portrayal of two famous DC characters Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn. Using feminist film theory and the male gaze (Mulvey, 1975), this study analyzed Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Wonder Woman (2017), Suicide Squad (2016), and Birds of Prey: The Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn (2020). This study concludes that in the films directed by men, Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn are passive objects to be used by men; while in the films directed by woman, they are active spectators in their own stories.
